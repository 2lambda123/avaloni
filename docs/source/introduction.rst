Introduction
============

In this introduction, we go over a simple example of list searching that illustrates
the main features of the language. It is assumed that you have a working local
installation and if you don't, please head over to :doc:`installation` for installation
instructions.

The classical example will feature a simple linear search function. But it will be a
generic function that can work with any type.

The quantum example, will feature Grover's search algorithm. Since the quantum interpreter
is still under implementation, this document will be updated only when the interpreter
is ready.


Classical search using linear search
------------------------------------

This section will demonstrate how types are created. It introduces the notions of
type constructors, type instances and value constructors. We will learn about creating
generic functions that can work with any type. Along the way we will learn about
pattern matching in order to inspect the content of values.

We will begin with a simple hello world example that we will fill later as we learn more.
The first piece of code introduces the main function as it is the entry point.


The main function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your program starts from the main function. This function must always be provided in
order to interpretation to work.
