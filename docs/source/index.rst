Avalon Programming Language
===========================

Avalon is new programming language based on algebraic data types.
It is not based on the Hindley-Milner type system since its type system is a lot more flexible.
Like any respectable programming language, it gives you a tool or two so you can hurt yourself:
you can have two functions with the same names and same parameters but different return types.

But why another programming language?
The chief reason is that Avalon seeks to foray into Quantum computing.
There are already a few programming languages that have entered the arena and Avalon seeks to provide additional value.

This documentation is the material for the reference implementation that comes in the form of an interpreter.
It will be updated as more features are implemented in the interpreter.
Some features will not be documented even when available until they are approved as permanent in the language.

To get started with the language, please head to the :doc:`introduction` which will guide you into
setting up your system and get started experimenting.
